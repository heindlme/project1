        I made a site for OMTech, which is a club that I am on the board for.
      </li>
      <li>
        There is a header on the top of each page.
      </li>
      <li>
        I have pages on my webiste: the home page, the about us page, the page with the board members, the page
        explaining history and past events of the club, the page with current events, and a page to contact us.
      </li>
      <li>
        My site has a navigation bar on the top of every page that shrinks to a dropdown menu when the page is too small
        for the bar.
      </li>
      <li>
        My site has different layouts for large and small screens. Most of the pages have media queries to help adjust
        the page and most items are sized by percentage for responsiveness.
      </li>
      <li>
        There is a coherent style across pages in a shared stylesheet called style.css and each page has their own
        stylesheet that is named similar to the page title with style in the name.
      </li>
      <li>
        My site has images that all have appropriate alt attributes.
      </li>
      <li>
        I have a favicon for the site that is a purple square that says Tech.
      </li>
      <li>
        All of my css files are in the same subfolder. Similarly for my javascript files and images. I put all of the
        files for my favicon in a subfolder, also. The only items in the main folder is my html files.
      </li>
      <li>
        My site does not use any libraries or third-party tools.
      </li>
      <li>
        All of my pages and stylesheets all validate without any warnings or errors.
      </li>
      <li>
        My site is stored on GitHub that is shared with my instructor.
      </li>
      <li>
        All of my files are kebab-case, so they are all lowercase and contain alphanumeric characters.
      </li>
      <li>
        My site is served out of port 8443 and it can only be accessed through HTTPS.
      </li>
      <li>
        All of my pages are neatly aligned with clear axes.
      </li>
      <li>
        My headings are in a sans-serif font. I have the default be Trebuchet MS with the backup being the sans-serif
        font family. My other text is in a serif font. It first tries Georgia, it then defaults to the serif font
        family.
      </li>
      <li>
        My site has a form element in the contact us page. It uses mailto that has the email heindlme@gmail.com, which
        is a dummy email for now. I know mailto isn't the most elegant way to collect data, but I was struggling to get
        any other way to work.
      </li>
      <li>
        My site has external links to our facebook page and the UWEC computer science homepage that open in a new tab.
      </li>
      <li>
        My source code is readable with meaningfull names for classes adn IDS.
      </li>
      <li>
        My site has a CSS animation on the homepage for an image slideshow.
      </li>
    </ul>

      Client's Clitique

    <p>
      When first visiting the website link, I was brought to a webpage with a carousel of images displaying the OMTech
      club. On first impression, I found it easy to read and navigate. Right away, I knew the organization that the
      website was for. I found the images to be a nice addition to the home page, and I felt that it gave me a good
      sense of the club. Although it would have been nice to be able to navigate through the images at my own
      accordâ€”being able to stop and start when I pleased. Nevertheless, the home page was easy to navigate and
      maintained its structure on mobile device.
    </p>
    <p>
      The About Us page did a great job explaining who the club was. I liked that the specific points were broken into
      bullets so that I did not have to read paragraphs of information. The Board page was creatively laid out, and I
      enjoyed seeing pictures of the members rather than just names. The history page did a great job on showing what
      the club had done in the past. While I liked the chronological lay out of it, it would have been nice to have more
      spacing between each event and different text size for the title vs the description of the event. I really liked
      the way that the Events page was laid out and found the colorful blocks for the titles to be aesthetic. Finally,
      the Contact Us page was what I expected and was easy to navigate if I wanted to send a message to OMTech.
    </p>
    <p>
      I really felt the website was straight forward and easy to maneuver. I liked that it maintained a similar color
      theme throughout the entire site; however, I do wish there had been a bit more color than just the black text. It
      was also mobile friendly and maintained its functionality and style regardless of screen size. One of my favorite
      parts was the use of a multitude of images, which not only gave me a good sense of the club but also broke up the
      text. Overall, I think the website does a great job of representing the OMTech club!
