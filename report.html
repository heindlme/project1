        <li>
         I made a site for OMTech, which is a club that I am on the board for.
        </li>
        <li>
          There is a header on the top of each page.
        </li>
        <li>
          I have pages on my webiste: the home page, the about us page, the page with the board members, the page explaining history and 
          past events of the club, the page with current events, and a page to contact us.
        </li>
        <li>
          My site has a navigation bar on the top of every page that shrinks to a dropdown menu when the page is too small for the bar.
        </li>
        <li>
          My site has different layouts for large and small screens. Most of the pages have media queries to help adjust the page and
          most items are sized by percentage for responsiveness.
        </li>
        <li>
          There is a coherent style across pages in a shared stylesheet called style.css and each page has their own stylesheet that
          is named similar to the page title with style in the name.
        </li>
        <li>
          My site has images that all have appropriate alt attributes.
        </li>
        <li>
          I have a favicon for the site that is a purple square that says Tech.
        </li>
        <li>
          All of my css files are in the same subfolder. Similarly for my javascript files and images. I put all of the files for
          my favicon in a subfolder, also. The only items in the main folder is my html files.
        </li>
        <li>
          My site does not use any libraries or third-party tools.
        </li>
        <li>
          All of my pages and stylesheets all validate without any warnings or errors.
        </li>
        <li>
          My site is stored on GitHub that is shared with my instructor.
        </li>
        <li>
          All of my files are kebab-case, so they are all lowercase and contain alphanumeric characters.
        </li>
        <li>
          My site is served out of port 8443 and it can only be accessed through HTTPS.
        </li>
        <li>
          All of my pages are neatly aligned with clear axes.
        </li>
        <li>
          My headings are in a sans-serif font. I have the default be Trebuchet MS with the backup being the sans-serif font family.
          My other text is in a serif font. It first tries Georgia, it then defaults to the serif font family.
        </li>
        <li>
          My site has a form element in the contact us page. It uses mailto that has the email heindlme@gmail.com, which is a dummy email
          for now. I know mailto isn't the most elegant way to collect data, but I was struggling to get any other way to work.
        </li>
        <li>
          My site has external links to our facebook page and the UWEC computer science homepage that open in a new tab.
        </li>
        <li>
          My source code is readable with meaningfull names for classes adn IDS.
        </li>
        <li>
          My site has a CSS animation on the homepage for an image slideshow.
        </li>
    </ul>
